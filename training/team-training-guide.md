## 3. Common Customer Questions and Responses

### 3.1 Product-Related Questions

**Q: What's the difference between open-loop and closed-loop sensors?**
A: Open-loop sensors use Hall effect technology with lower cost and power consumption but lower accuracy (±1-2%). Closed-loop sensors use magnetically balanced technology with higher accuracy (±0.1-0.5%) but higher cost and power consumption.

**Q: Do you have automotive-grade sensors?**
A: Yes, our HAH, CAB, and DHAB series are AEC-Q100 certified for automotive applications.

**Q: What's the accuracy of your high-precision sensors?**
A: Our IT series has ±0.05% accuracy, HO series has ±0.1% accuracy, ideal for metrology applications.

### 3.2 Technical Support

**Q: How do I select the right sensor for my application?**
A: Consider: rated current range, accuracy requirements, response time, isolation needs, and environmental conditions. Our FAE team can provide specific guidance.

**Q: What's the temperature range of your sensors?**
A: Standard sensors work from -40°C to +85°C. Automotive sensors are rated to higher temperatures depending on series.

### 3.3 Order-Related Questions

**Q: How long is the lead time for samples?**
A: Typically 3-5 business days for standard products. Custom solutions may take longer.

**Q: What's your minimum order quantity?**
